# Advanced-Multivariate-Statistics

This repo contains in it a project I did at UCT where the aim of this study is to derive sparse principal components - a set of sparse vectors that explain maximum possible amount of variance in the SA youth data to address
this issue. Sparse PCA merges the benefits of traditional PCA, namely data reduction, with sparsity modeling, which removes ineffective variables from the PCA model by reducing their loadings to zero
