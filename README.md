# Advanced-Multivariate-Statistics

This repo contains in it a project I did at UCT. Find the project proposal, final project write up and the code to see all the analysis. 

The goal of this project starts on a premise that SA youth data provided by Stellenbosch-based company, Predictive Insights is highly dimensional in its nature. This presents a critical challenge of being able to sufficiently reduce the dimensionality of the data to extract relevant and intepretable features as means towards building robust models to predict which young people will find employment. Thus, I set to derive sparse principal components from this Youth dataset - a set of sparse vectors that explain maximum possible amount of variance in the SA youth data to address
this issue. In short, Sparse PCA merges the benefits of traditional PCA, namely data reduction, with sparsity modeling, which removes ineffective variables from the PCA model by reducing their loadings to zero. It's usefulness is massively on the intepretation of the extracted PC features.
