# Advanced-Multivariate-Statistics

This repo contains in it a project I did at UCT. Find the project proposal, the final project write up, the presentation and the code to see all the analysis. 

The goal of this project starts on a premise that SA Youth data, provided by Stellenbosch-based company, Predictive Insights, is highly dimensional in its nature. This presents a critical challenge of being able to sufficiently reduce the dimensionality of the data to extract relevant and intepretable features; this is an important pre step before building robust models to predict which young people will find employment. Thus, I set to derive sparse principal components from this SA Youth dataset - a set of sparse principal component vectors that explain maximum possible amount of variance in the data to address
this issue. In short, Sparse PCA merges the benefits of traditional PCA, namely data reduction, with sparsity modeling, which removes ineffective variables from the PCA model by reducing their loadings to zero. It's usefulness is massively on the intepretation of the extracted PC features. 

From this point afterwards, I can set to answer the BIG question: What effect does the demographic characteristics, previous and current labour market experience and education outcomes have on the employability of a person in their youth, in the South African labour market ?
